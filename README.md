Firefox IFSI
============
Firefox bugs, features, and lack of features.

This is simply an extension skeleton to play around with.

Installation
============
Navigate to:

  ~/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE_NAME/extensions

...and create a file named:

  ifsi@lousycoder.com

Inside that file, write the path of this project (making sure it ends in slash).

Gotchas
=======
If your XUL files are malformed, Firefox will fail silently.  Double check them by loading them in Firefox first.
