Nagger Stomper
============
This is simply an extension skeleton to play around with.

Installation
============
Navigate to:

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE_NAME/extensions

...and create a file named:

    naggerstomper@pseudony.ms

Inside that file, write the path of this project (making sure it ends in slash).

Thanks

Thanks to retiman for a great firefox extension skeleton, and for complaining loudly enough about NoScript to inspire this extension.
