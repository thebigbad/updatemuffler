Nagger Stomper
============
Nagger Stomper prevents NoScript and friends from bothering you with "Successful Update" pages by closing tabs that are opened to known nag pages.

Installation
============

### If you just want to try it out

Go to the downloads section of this github project, and install the .xpi

### If you want to muck around with it

Navigate to:

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE_NAME/extensions

...and create a file named:

    naggerstomper@pseudony.ms

Inside that file, write the path of this project (making sure it ends in slash).

Thanks
======
Thanks to [retiman](http://github.com/retiman) for a great firefox extension skeleton, and for complaining loudly enough about NoScript to inspire this extension.
